10 Surefire Ways To Live Below Your Full Potential

Do you know that most people never utilize more than 0.1% of their true potential in their lifetime?

It's true. The thing is,human potential is unlimited.Unlike computers,you'll never come across a situation
where your brain says the hard drive is full. Your can constantly push your limits,reaching greater heights,
only to find that you're not even reaching a fraction of your true worth!Believe it or not you harness more 
power than you can ever imagine.

Unfortunately,many do not utilize their true potential,and lay it to waste by engaging in tasks that are a
poor use of their time and energy.Here are 10 sure-fire ways to live below your true potential.

1.Harp on the past instead of focusing on the present
Some people spend their lives living in the past.They lament about what has been,what the could have done,and
why they didn't do that.However,the past is the past,and no matter how much time we spend thinking and lamenting
about it,it doesn't change anything.To spend time moping about what has been is waste the person you can be.

There were times in the past when I wondered how things would have been if I did X instead of Y.Or if I did Z
instead of Y.However,after that I'd ask myself,"How would this change anything?"Me sitting here and thinking about
the past does absolutely nothing to change things and improve my life.Instead,it is only by thinking forward and 
taking action that I'm able to live a truly fulfilling life.

what kind of future do you want to create?What actions can you take to create this ideal future?What have you 
learned from the past that will help you in the journey?Asking and acting on questions like these will help you
to maximize your present moment so you can live your best life going forward.For some practical guidance on living
in the present,I recommend The Power of Now.
